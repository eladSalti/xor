xor_decrypt: function takes a list of encrypted bytes (encrypted_text) and a key string (key), and decrypts the bytes
using the XOR encryption/decryption algorithm by XOR-ing each byte with the corresponding byte from the key using
modular arithmetic to wrap around the key as necessary. The resulting decrypted bytes are then converted to characters
using the ASCII encoding, and appended to a string that represents the decrypted text. The function returns the
decrypted text as a string.

guess_key: function takes an encrypted text as a list of integers (encrypted_text) and a key size (key_size),
and iterates over all possible keys of length key_size to decrypt the text using the xor_decrypt function.
Each possible key and decrypted text pair that meets the criteria of containing only printable ASCII characters is
added to a list of matches, which is returned at the end of the function.
